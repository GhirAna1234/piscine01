1. Iterative Approach (Loop) - O(n)O(n)

This approach uses a simple loop to multiply nb by itself n times.
Algorithm (Iterative)

    Set result = 1.
    Repeat n times:
        Multiply result by x.
    Return result.
✅ Pros: More efficient, avoids stack overflow
❌ Cons: Slightly longer code
