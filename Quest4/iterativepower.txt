This approach avoids recursion by using a loop.
Algorithm (Iterative Approach)

    Initialize result = 1.
    Loop from 1 to n, multiplying result by x in each iteration.
    Return result.

Algorithm in Steps

Power_Iterative(x, n):
  result = 1
  For i from 1 to n:
    result = result * x
  Return result

‚úÖ Pros: No recursion, avoids stack overflow.
‚è≥ Time Complexity: O(n)O(n)
üìå Space Complexity: O(1)O(1) (constant space)
